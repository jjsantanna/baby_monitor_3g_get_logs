# About
This is a personal project for monitoring my first daughter (who will/was born in May/2019). The idea is to monitor her:
1. noise (cry); 
2. vital signs (heart rate and oxigenation level) while sleeping;
3. weight;
4. environment;

0. MagicMirror
1. Baby Monitor 3G (iOS and MacOS app): for capturing and classifying sound (i.e. crying);
